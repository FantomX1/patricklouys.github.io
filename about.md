Hi, my name is Patrick and I am a software developer from Zurich, Switzerland. 
I have been programming for more than 12 years, focusing mostly on PHP.


I'm self-taught and it took me a long time to learn how
to write good code. I learned from many different
resources, mostly from non-PHP books. I am writing a [book](/professional-php) so
that you don't have to go through the same trouble as me.

If you want to get in touch, you can find me in [room 11 on stackoverflow](http://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/11/php), on [GitHub](https://github.com/PatrickLouys) or send me an email at patrick@louys.ch
